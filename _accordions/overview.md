## Overview
{: .h2.mb-4}

This project was developed for the purpose of implementing 
**service workers**, and other PWA functionality, into a specific 
**JAMStack architecture** that I use to develop at work.
{: .p}

Most JS documentation on service workers (or any other feature for that matter,) 
only shows minimal examples of each feature or method—in a very piecemeal way—leaving 
you to put it all together. instead, I wanted to provide a real-world example of 
implementing service workers, and the challenges I faced.
{:.p}

The JAMStack architecture use at work is a `Jekyll`{: .code}, `Nodejs`{: .code}, 
`Webpack`{: .code} + `sass-laoder`{: .code} + `Corejs`{: .code} + `Babel`{: .code} +
`ES6`{: .code} ,  `SASS`{: .code}, etc.... setup.
{: .p}

The two most important APIs used include **Google Sheets v4** and **Google Docs**.

Our build process is handled using npm-scripts (<code class="code mx-1 code__bash">npm run <span class="code--blue">&lt;SCRIPT_NAME&gt;</span></code> ) 
and the npm package `npm-run-all`{: .code} which gives us the ability to run npm scripts sequentially and in-parallel.
{: .p}

Using `npm-run-all`{: .code} we are able to run our **Jekyll command** and **Webpack commands** in parallel:
{: .p.mb-1}

- **Jekyll** handles the local sever with it's `--livereload`{: .code} option and, of course, 
  compiles the static site&nbsp;files.
- **Webpack** handles transforming our Custom ES6 files into cross-browser JS, and compiles, 
  prefixes, and minifies custom SCSS into stylesheets.

We utilize our own custom Webpack plugin (built for Webpack 5) to generate a YAML file. \
_This YAML file contains the **hash of the main bundle**_ (this is the same 
hash&mdash;`'[fullHash]'`{: .code}&mdash;accessed inside a `webpack.config.js`{: .code} file using: 
`filename: '[name].[fullhash].js'`{: .code}.)
{: .p}

_To be clear, when I use the word **"hash"** in this document, 
I'm referring to the hash (i.e. the random looking string of characters) that Webpack 
calculates from the files it consumed (e.g. `c1ffa09121e3327be06c`{: .code}.)_
